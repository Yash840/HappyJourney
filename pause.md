# About : Pausing Development on HappyJourney

Hello Everyone,
I am Yash, Project Lead and Head Developer of this project, Feeling very sad to pause development of this project right now. This is not end of this project, But taking break is always better than mess up. This decision taken due to lack of proficieny in skills required to make this project scalable and advanced. This will continued after reaching its requirements.
